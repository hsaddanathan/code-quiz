# code-quiz


## Summary
In this assignment, we were tasked with building out a timed coding quiz that stores high scores. I created my base `index.html` file with just a skeleton of the site. With the help of Javascript and DOM Manipulation I was able to build out the quiz to populate questions and answer choices dynamically. Once a user interacts with a button they move to the next question. If they get the question wrong, there timer reduces by 15 seconds. Once the user finishes the quiz, the time remaining is there total score and a new screen appears dynamically requesting input of the users initials. Once the user submits the initials their initials and scores are saved to the local storage.
